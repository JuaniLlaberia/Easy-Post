## easyPOST Social Media Project

In this project I built my version of a post based social media web application. Where users are able to upload post including text, images and gifs, create accounts and edit their profiles, like and comment posts, follow users and receive notifications on realtime. When I started the development process for easyPOST, I have been coding React for a while but decided to test Next.Js with some of its features and Firebase to be able to store all the data needed for the application.
